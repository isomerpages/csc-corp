Rory leads the Behavioural Insights Team’s work across the Asia-Pacific, and has been with BIT since its inception in 2010. He has led trials and policy interventions across the region in a range of policy areas, from employment and education, to health and housing.
 
Based in Sydney since November 2012, Rory led the establishment of the New South Wales Department of Premier and Cabinet’s Behavioural Insights Unit — the first Australian agency dedicated to applying BI to public policy. He also set up and leads BIT’s Australia office, which works with a number of State and Commonwealth Departments, as well as NGOs and philanthropic bodies across the country.
 
Rory also oversees BIT's work in the APAC region, including the BIT's Singapore office, and helped establish the first BI trials and teams in Singapore. Rory holds a PhD in health and behaviour change from Cambridge University. He has been a Visiting Fellow at the Singapore Civil Service College since 2014, and an Honorary member of the University of Melbourne’s School of Psychological Sciences since 2018.
 
Prior to joining BIT, Rory worked in the UK Prime Minister’s Strategy Unit and the UK Department of Education.
 
He is the co-author of ‘Think Small: The surprisingly simple ways to reach big goals’.
