Professor Martin Richard John Knapp is a researcher, research leader and teacher, mainly in the areas of health and social care policy and practice. He has been Professor of Social Policy and Director of the Personal Social Services Research Unit (PSSRU) at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) since 1996. Since 2009, he has also been Director of the School for Social Care Research funded by the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR).

His personal research in recent years has primarily been in the areas of adult social care, child and adult mental health, dementia and autism. Much of this work has an economic focus; all of it aims to be relevant to either policy discussion or frontline practice development. He has published his research widely, including almost more than 550 peer-review journal articles, 14 books and a large number of other outputs.

Research that he has conducted or led has fed through to have a number of policy and other impacts, both in the UK and elsewhere. This was recognised in part, for example, by the award of the Queen’s Anniversary Prize for Higher and Further Education in 2009 to both of the departments in which he worked at the time (at LSE and King’s College London), the 4* Impact Case Study in the 2014 REF, and citation in numerous central government and local policy documents.

His teaching in recent years has been in the areas of health and social care policy, and health and social care economics. He has supervised 40 PhD/MPhil students to successful completion, and currently supervise another six. A number of his former students have gone on to senior positions in academia, public sector bodies and elsewhere.

He is currently a member of numerous advisory groups for government departments, quasi-government, third sector, international and local bodies.
