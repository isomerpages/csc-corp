		<h4>Register for a Programme:</h4>
		<p class="mini-header">Searching for a programme</p> 
		<p>
	You can search for your preferred programmes on <a href="https://go.gov.sg/csc-corporatewebsite-programmeportal/">CSC programme portal</a>. You will be able to filter your search by Domain, Programme Type, Audience, Duration, Period and Cost. To filter by Domain, click on the “Discover Our Programmes” button at the top of the page. A small pop-out window will appear, and you can select your preferred domains when you click on the “Select a Domain” field. The other filters are found at the left-hand side of the page where the programmes are listed.
</p>
		<p class="mini-header">No suitable date for the programme you wish to register</p>
		<p>Sign up at 'Add to Watchlist' to get a notification when the next available run is published on the programme portal.</p>
		<p class="mini-header">How to Register</p>
		<p>You can register via our <a href="https://register.csc.gov.sg/">CSC programme portal</a>, navigate to your desired programme, and click on the "Apply Now” button. Your Training Coordinator has up to 3 working days to approve your registration request. Once it’s been approved, you’ll receive an email notification.</p>

<p>Note: To attend milestone programmes, you have to be nominated by your agency. Contact your Training Coordinator to find out more.</p>
		<p>Click <a href="/files/steps%20to%20perform%20registration%20on%20pp.pdf">here</a> to view guide</p>
		<p class="mini-header">When to Register</p>
		<p>Register for a programme at least 1 month before the start date. Most programmes accept registrations on a first-come, first-serve basis, so it’s better to register early. Pro tip:&nbsp; Registration normally closes 5 working days before each programme’s start date, unless otherwise stated.</p>
		<p class="mini-header">Confirming your Registration</p>
		<p>We’ll let you know about your registration status 2 to 3 weeks before the programme starts. Once your registration is confirmed, we’ll send you a Programme Placement Letter (PPL) via a system-generated email from CSCOLLEGE Donotreply.  While we’ll always do our best to confirm your registration as early as possible, sometimes classes are postponed or cancelled due to unforeseen circumstances.</p>
		<p class="mini-header">Learning with Disabilities</p>
		<p>The Civil Service College is committed to creating a learning environment that meets the diverse needs of its participants. If you anticipate or experience any barriers to learning in the programme you are interested in, please feel free to discuss your concerns with your Training Coordinator and CSC’s <a href="mailto:cscollege@cscollege.gov.sg">Customer Experience Team</a>. Learners with disabilities may also wish to work with your Training Coordinator and CSC’s Customer Experience Team to discuss options to improve the learning experience for you. Please also let us know what level of assistance you prefer.</p>
		<h4>Attending Your Programme: Face-to-Face</h4>
		<p class="mini-header">Where do I find the classroom details</p>
<p>A system-generated welcome email, from CSCOLLEGE Donotreply, will be sent to you at least 1 week prior to the class commencement date. Login to <a href="https://dc.learn.gov.sg/">LEARN DC</a> and scroll down to the “My Programmes” to select the grid containing the name of the course you are attending. Then, scroll down to the “Table of Contents” to find:</p> <ol>
<li>The pre-course materials under the “Pre-course Preparations” grid</li>
	<li>Remember to complete any pre-course assignment that is required for the class</li>
	<li>Classroom link/details under the “Classroom Details” grid</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Here is <a href="https://go.gov.sg/learndc-proginfo">a simple guide</a> with the steps to login to Learn DC and access the programme information.</p>
		<p class="mini-header">Let Us Know You’re Here</p>
		<p>Simply scan your NRIC, driving licence or staff pass at any of our kiosks conveniently located throughout CSC. If you have any other form of identification with your NRIC barcode on it, that'll work too.</p>
		<p class="mini-header">Where to Find the Kiosks</p>
		<p>
			There are 10 Kiosks conveniently located throughout CSC:
		</p><ul>
			<li>Level 1 - 3 kiosks</li>
			<li>Level 2 - 1 kiosk</li>
			<li>Level 3 - 3 kiosks</li>
			<li>Level 4 - 1 kiosk</li>
			<li>Level 5 - 2 kiosks</li>
		</ul>
		<p>You may scan your ID at any kiosk - it doesn't matter where your class is being held.
		</p>
		<p class="mini-header">How Many Times to Scan</p>
		<p>You only need to scan your ID once per day. If your class takes place over a few days, you'll need to scan your ID on each and every day.</p>
		<p class="mini-header">I Didn’t Bring Any ID</p>
		<p>You can manually enter your NRIC number at any kiosk to let us know you're here.</p>
		<p class="mini-header">I Forgot to Scan My ID</p>
		<p>Unfortunately, this would mean you will not receive your e-certificate for the class.</p>
		<p class="mini-header">Name Labels</p>
		<p>After you've scanned your ID, a personalised name label will be printed for you. For security purposes, you must display your name label prominently at all times when in CSC.</p>
		<p class="mini-header">My Label Went Missing</p>
		<p>You can reprint your name label if you need to. You can do so at any time between 8.00am to 5.15pm on the day of your class.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Name</li>
  <li>NRIC</li>

		<p class="mini-header">Update Your Agency's Contact List</p>
			<p>Email us <a href="mailto:cscollege@cscollege.gov.sg">cscollege@cscollege.gov.sg</a> with the updates.</p>
			<h4>Registering Your Officers for Programmes</h4>
			<p class="mini-header">Individual or Bulk Registration</p>
			<p>You can register up to 4 officers per agency for each run of a programme. However, this number may vary based on the programme. Keep this in mind when registering your officers for programmes. We’ll contact you if we’re unable to accept all or some of your registrations.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br><br>
Pro tip: You can also use the Individual or Bulk Registration function to register yourself for programmes.</p>
			<p>Click <a href="/files/steps%20to%20submit%20registration%20on%20pp_tc.pdf">here</a> to view guide</p>
			<p class="mini-header">Registration Closing Dates</p>
			<p>Registration normally closes 5 working days before the start date, unless otherwise stated. If your officer chooses to register just before the closing date, you may need to submit the application directly on their behalf to avoid unsuccessful registration. </p>
			<p class="mini-header">Reviewing Your Officer’s Registration</p>
			<p>When your officer registers for a programme, you have up to 3 working days to review and approve the registration request. Once you’ve approved it, your officer will be notified via email. However, if you register on an officer’s behalf, there is no review or approval required.</p>
			<p>Click <a target="_blank" href="/files/steps%20to%20approve%20application.pdf">here</a> to view guide</p>
			<p class="mini-header">Unable to Review Registrations in Time</p>
			<p>If you don’t respond to a registration request by the end of the second day, it will be routed to your Covering TC. Both the officer and you will be cc-ed in the email to your Covering TC. Any registration request not approved after 3 days will lapse and cannot be reactivated. The officer can re-submit a new application if their application has lapsed.</p>
			<p class="mini-header">How to set “Covering Training Coordinator (TC)”</p>
			<p>A Covering TC is another TC whom a pending application would be routed to for approval, if the selected TC does not approve the application by the end of the second day. You can set your Covering TC on the “Profile” page by clicking on the “Covering TC” button.&nbsp;

</p><p>Note: Only one Covering TC can be assigned to each TC.</p>
			<p class="mini-header">Registration Status</p>
					<p>We’ll email the officer and you about the registration status 2 to 3 weeks before the programme starts. If registration is successful:             </p><ul>
			<li>The officer will receive a Programme Placement Letter (PPL).</li>
			<li>You will receive a PPL summary for each programme. It lists the officers from your agency attending the programme.</li>
		</ul>
	<p>Note: Whenever possible, we will send the PPLs as soon as the programme is confirmed. In most cases, we can only confirm the programme 3 weeks before it starts.
		</p>
			<p class="mini-header">Contacting Us</p>
	<p>You can reach us in many ways. Find out more on our <a href="/contact-us">Contact Us</a> page.</p>
			<h4>Withdrawing/Replacing/Transferring Your Officers for Programmes</h4>
<p>All requests for withdrawal, replacement and/or transfer of participants are to be submitted by an agency’s TC via a Withdrawal / Replacement / Transfer Request Form in the TC module on the CSC Programme Portal. CSC will no longer handle email requests from learners, and will re-direct them back to their TCs.</p>
			<p>TCs will be prompted to provide the following information:</p><ul>
			<li>TC’s details</li>
			<li>Details of the programme that officer is withdrawing from</li>
			<li>Details of withdrawing officer</li>
			<li>Reasons for withdrawing</li>
			<li>If transferring to another session, the dates of the session to be transferred to</li>
			<li>If there is one, the replacement officer’s details</li>
			<li>Replacement Officer’s TC details and Billing Contact Details</li></ul>
<p>It is important to note that penalty fees will be levied if the notification to withdraw is received after the Programme Placement Letter has been sent, or less than 3 weeks before the class start date, whichever is later. Please see timeline below:		</p> 
<p>If penalty fees are incurred, CSC will assess if the penalty can be waived based on the reasons provided by the TC in the form. CSC will then inform the TC of the outcome over email within 5 working days.</p>
			<p>Please also note the timelines for replacements and transfers:</p><ul>
			<li>Replacement requests: at least 5 working days before class starts</li>
<li>Transfer requests: at least 5 working days before the original class starts and at least 5 working days before the new class starts.</li></ul>
		<h4>Attendance of Your Officers</h4>
	<p class="mini-header">Let Us Know They’re Here</p>
			<p>Your officers simply need to scan their NRIC, driving licence or staff pass (any form of identification with their NRIC barcode on it) at any of the kiosks conveniently located throughout CSC. If they do not have any form of identification with them, they can manually enter their NRIC number at the kiosks.</p>

<p class="mini-header">Name Labels for Officers</p>
			<p>After scanning, a personalised name label will be printed. For security purposes, your officers must display their name labels prominently at all times when in CSC. Name labels can be re-printed if requested (anytime between 8.00am to 5.15pm).</p>
	<p class="mini-header">Where to Get Assistance</p>
			<p>Officers can email us at <a href="mailto:cscollege@cscollege.gov.sg">cscollege@cscollege.gov.sg</a> if they require assistance before their programme. If they require assistance on the day of their programme, they can approach the Trainers or Programme Administrators.</p>
	<p class="mini-header">More Questions?</p>
			<p>If you have any questions not addressed above, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:cscollege@cscollege.gov.sg">cscollege@cscollege.gov.sg.</a></p>
			<h4>Request for In-House Training</h4>
	<p class="mini-header">In-House Training</p>
			<p>We offer in-house training programmes to meet your agency’s specific needs and challenges. You can choose from standard or customised in-house programmes.</p>
	<p class="mini-header">Standard In-house Programmes</p>
			<p>A standard in-house programme covers the same material as a public run programme. The advantage is that your organisation can choose the location and timing of the programme, and which officers to participate in it. Most programmes have an in-house option.</p>
			<p class="mini-header">Customised In-house Programmes</p>
			<p>If your agency has specific work challenges, a standard in-house programme may not meet your needs. We can customise our programmes by working with you to analyse and determine your agency’s training needs. If you’re keen, please contact your Agency Engagement Manager*.</p>
			<p class="mini-header">Class Sizes</p>
			<p>The minimum and maximum class sizes for in-house training are fixed. If your agency does not meet the minimum class size, please register them for a public-run instead.</p>
			<p class="mini-header">Costs</p>
			<p>Please contact your Agency Engagement Manager* to ask for a cost estimate.</p>
			<p class="mini-header">Venues</p>
			<p>We can conduct in-house programmes at CSC or at a location of your choice, as long as heavy logistics or specialised equipment are not required. You can reduce costs by having the programme conducted at your office.</p>
			<p class="mini-header">How to Apply for In-House Training</p>
			<p>Submit your agency's request <a target="_blank" href="https://form.gov.sg/60545d6f248bbc0012cc8ae5">here</a> or email your Agency Engagement Manager* with the following:
			</p><ul>
				<li>Programme title</li>
				<li>Course code</li>
				<li>Preferred venue (CSC or your agency’s venue)</li>
				<li>Preferred training period (please allow a lead time of 8 weeks)</li>
				<li>Number of times you’d like to run the programme</li>
				<li>Standard in-house or customised programme request</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We’ll respond within 3 – 5 working days. </p>
