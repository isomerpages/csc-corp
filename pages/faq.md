		<h4>Register for a Programme:</h4>
		<p class="mini-header">Searching for a programme</p> 
		<p>
	You can search for your preferred programmes on CSC’s Programme Portal. You will be able to filter your search by Domain, Programme Type, Audience, Duration, Period and Cost. To filter by Domain, click on the “Discover Our Programmes” button at the top of the page. A small pop-out window will appear, and you can select your preferred domains when you click on the “Select a Domain” field. The other filters are found at the left-hand side of the page where the programmes are listed.
</p>
		<p class="mini-header">No suitable data for the programme you wish to register</p>
		<p>Sign up at 'Add to Watchlist' to get a notification when the next available run is published on the programme portal.</p>
		<p class="mini-header">How to Register</p>
		<p>You can register via our <a href="https://register.csc.gov.sg/">CSC programme portal</a>. navigate to your desired programme, and click on the "Apply Now” button. Your Training Coordinator has up to 3 working days to approve your registration request. Once it’s been approved, you’ll receive an email notification.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Note: To attend milestone programmes, you have to be nominated by your agency. Contact your Training Coordinator to find out more.</p>
		<p class="mini-header">When to Register</p>
		<p>Register for a programme at least 1 month before the start date. Most programmes accept registrations on a first-come, first-serve basis, so it’s better to register early. Pro tip:&nbsp; Registration normally closes 5 working days before each programme’s start date, unless otherwise stated.</p>
		<p class="mini-header">Confirming your Registration</p>
		<p>We’ll let you know about your registration status 2 to 3 weeks before the programme starts. Once your registration is confirmed, we’ll send you a Programme Placement Letter (PPL) via email. The PPL will contain administrative details of your programme. While we’ll always do our best to confirm your registration as early as possible, sometimes classes are postponed or cancelled due to unforeseen circumstances.</p>
		<p class="mini-header">Learning with Disabilities</p>
		<p>The Civil Service College is committed to creating a learning environment that meets the diverse needs of its participants. If you anticipate or experience any barriers to learning in the programme you are interested in, please feel free to discuss your concerns with your Training Coordinator and CSC’s Customer Experience Team. Learners with disabilities may also wish to work with your Training Coordinator and CSC’s Customer Experience Team to discuss options to improve the learning experience for you. Please also let us know what level of assistance you prefer.</p>
		<h4>Attending Your Programme:</h4>
		<p class="mini-header">Let Us Know You’re Here</p>
		<p>Simply scan your NRIC, driving licence or staff pass at any of our kiosks conveniently located throughout CSC. If you have any other form of identification with your NRIC barcode on it, that'll work too.</p>
		<p class="mini-header">Where to Find the Kiosks</p>
		<p>
			There are 10 Kiosks conveniently located throughout CSC:
		</p><ul>
			<li>Level 1 - 4 kiosks</li>
			<li>Level 2 - 1 kiosk</li>
			<li>Level 3 - 3 kiosks</li>
			<li>Level 4 - 1 kiosk</li>
			<li>Level 5 - 1 kiosk</li>
		</ul>
		You may scan your ID at any kiosk - it doesn't matter where your class is being held.
		<p></p>
		<p class="mini-header">How Many Times to Scan</p>
		<p>You only need to scan your ID once per day. If your class takes place over a few days, you'll need to scan your ID on each and every day.</p>
		<p class="mini-header">I Didn’t Bring Any ID</p>
		<p>You can manually enter your NRIC number at any kiosk to let us know you're here.</p>
		<p class="mini-header">I Forgot to Scan My ID</p>
		<p>Unfortunately, this would mean you will not receive your e-certificate for the class.</p>
		<p class="mini-header">Name Labels</p>
		<p>After you've scanned your ID, a personalised name label will be printed for you. For security purposes, you must display your name label prominently at all times when in CSC.</p>
		<p class="mini-header">My Label Went Missing</p>
		<p>You can reprint your name label if you need to. You can do so at any time between 8.00am to 5.15pm on the day of your class.</p>
		<p class="mini-header">I’m Replacing My Colleague</p>
		<p>Contact your Training Coordinator to find out the title or code of the programme you are supposed to attend. Once you have that information, you can enter it any of the kiosks to e-register your attendance. The kiosk will prompt you to key in the name of the colleague you are replacing, so please have this information ready as well.</p>
		<p class="mini-header">The Colleague I’m Replacing Has Turned Up for Class</p>
		<p>Please double check with your Training Coordinator. If you still need to replace your colleague, please approach the Course Administrator or Trainer for further assistance.</p>
		<p class="mini-header">I’ve Been Replaced By Mistake</p>
		<p>Please verify with your Training Coordinator or contact us for further assistance.</p>
		<h4>Cancelling Your Registration:</h4>
		<p class="mini-header">Cancelling your application before Training Coordinator (TC) approval</p>
		<p>You may cancel an application that your TC has not yet approved on the portal directly under the “Check Application Staus” page by clicking on the “Withdraw” button on the relevant application under the “Pending Applications” section.   </p>
		<p class="mini-header">Sending a Replacement</p>
		<p>For most programmes, we’re happy to let your colleague replace you at no extra charge. We strongly encourage you to select a colleague with a similar profile, so he or she can fully benefit from the programme.<br>Email us at cscollege@cscollege.gov.sg at least 5 working days before the programme starts. Include the following:
		</p><ul>
			<li>Your name</li>
			<li>Programme title</li>
			<li>Programme date(s)</li>
			<li>Your replacement’s details:</li>
			<ol>
				<li>Name</li>
				<li>NRIC</li>
				<li>Email Address</li>
				<li>Department</li>
		 </ol>
		</ul>
	Note: For programmes that require pre-coursework or screening, we’ll let you know if your request to send a replacement is successful.
		<p class="mini-header">Withdrawing Your Registration</p>
		<p>If you can’t find a colleague to replace you, or if the programme doesn’t allow for it, you’ll need to withdraw your registration. To do so, email us at cscollege@cscollege.gov.sg at least 3 weeks before the programme starts to avoid any penalty charges.&nbsp;

If you withdraw your registration less than 3 weeks before the programme starts, a withdrawal fee will be incurred (equivalent to 25% of the programme fee).&nbsp;

If you don’t withdraw your registration at all, you’ll be considered absent and the full programme fee will be charged.</p>

			<h4>Registering Your Officers for Programmes</h4>
			<p class="mini-header">Individual or Bulk Registration</p>
			<p>You can register up to 4 officers per agency for each run of a programme. However, this number may vary based on the programme. Keep this in mind when registering your officers for programmes. We’ll contact you if we’re unable to accept all or some of your registrations.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Pro tip: You can also use the Individual or Bulk Registration function to register yourself for programmes.</p>
			<p class="mini-header">Registration Closing Dates</p>
			<p>Registration normally closes 5 working days before the start date, unless otherwise stated. If your officer chooses to register just before the closing date, you may need to submit the application directly on their behalf to avoid unsuccessful registration. </p>

			<p>When your officer registers for a programme, you have up to 3 working days to review and approve the registration request. Once you’ve approved it, your officer will be notified via email. However, if you register on an officer’s behalf, there is no review or approval required.</p>
			<p class="mini-header">Unable to Review Registrations in Time</p>
			<p>If you don’t respond to a registration request by the end of the second day, it will be routed to your Covering TC. Both the officer and you will be cc-ed in the email to your Covering TC. Any registration request not approved after 3 days will lapse and cannot be reactivated. The officer can re-submit a new application if their application has lapsed.</p>
			<p class="mini-header">How to set “Covering Training Coordinator (TC)”</p>
			<p>A Covering TC is another TC whom a pending application would be routed to for approval, if the selected TC does not approve the application by the end of the second day. You can set your Covering TC on the “Profile” page by clicking on the “Covering TC” button.&nbsp;

Note: Only one Covering TC can be assigned to each TC.</p>
			<p class="mini-header">Registration Status</p>
					<p>We’ll email the officer and you about the registration status 2 to 3 weeks before the programme starts. If registration is successful:             </p><ul>
			<li>The officer will receive a Programme Placement Letter (PPL).</li>
			<li>You will receive a PPL summary for each programme. It lists the officers from your agency attending the programme.</li>
		</ul>
		Note: Whenever possible, we will send the PPLs as soon as the programme is confirmed. In most cases, we can only confirm the programme 3 weeks before it starts.
