<p>
	Launched in August 2018, INN x CSC is an innovation sandbox, where public officers can come together to ideate, experiment, collaborate, and learn with one another. We encourage you to adopt a 'Dream big, test early, and fail fast' approach for your work challenges, and enable you to iterate and create more timely solutions. INN x CSC occupies 1,400sqm at the iconic Jurong Town Hall Building. It is a flexible space to cater to your corporate and learning needs. We have empowered many transformative learning experiences, such as bringing together learning communities and organising hackathons, seminars or work retreats
</p>


<h3>Inclusive</h3>
<p>No matter who you are or what you do, you are welcome here. This is a safe space where you get to experiment without being judged and where you can candidly share your knowledge and insights to create a cohesive learning community.</p>
<h3>Iterative</h3>
<p>In everything that we do, iterating helps us to refine ideas and concepts to obtain better or even optimal results. Through engaging discussions and hands-on activities, you will experience first-hand challenges and satisfaction of iterating.</p>
<h3>Independent</h3>
<p>Learning is a lifelong process. We will ignite the spark in you to continuously learn, and empower you with the freedom to learn anytime, anywhere and at your own pace.</p>
<h3>Inventive</h3>
<p>We encourage you to explore unconventional, possibly even wild ideas and inspire you to make innovative yet effective recommendations for a future-ready public service.</p>
<h3>Involved</h3>
<p>We can't deliver effective policies and services to our citizens if we don't know what works for them, and what doesn't. At INN x CSC, you will be plugged into the ground through various hands-on and first-hand learning interventions and projects designed to bring the 'voice of user' to the forefront.</p>
