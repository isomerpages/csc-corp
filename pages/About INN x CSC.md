<p>
	Launched in August 2018, INN x CSC is an innovation sandbox, where public officers can come together to ideate, experiment, collaborate, and learn with one another. We encourage you to adopt a 'Dream big, test early, and fail fast' approach for your work challenges, and enable you to iterate and create more timely solutions. INN x CSC occupies 1,400sqm at the iconic Jurong Town Hall Building. It is a flexible space to cater to your corporate and learning needs. We have empowered many transformative learning experiences, such as bringing together learning communities and organising hackathons, seminars or work retreats
